<center><p>IT: Chapter 2 was one of if not the worst movie ive ever watched the orginal movie left some aspect to be desired
however the IT: Chapter 2 atleast in my option was a snooze feast and at a certain point a child sneezed and everyone redirected there attetion towards him. Most of the movie was expostion for what happend in between the 27 years in the movies it was a big let down i thought the big show down between the losers club and pennywise was going to make up for it but no when worse got to worst they ended up bullying the clown to death no for real they bullied it by calling it a stupid clown the
best part was the actors who did the best they could with the horrible script another silver lining was the deaths since IT: Chapter 2 really had me upset over the deathes (no spoliers). I would not suggest you go waste your money on this trash of a movie.
